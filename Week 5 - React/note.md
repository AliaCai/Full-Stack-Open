React -> js library for building interactive interface <-angular(framework),vue>
-> a tree of components
->component based architechure
->render the view & the view is synce with the state
->little api to lean, use other libraries

application: 
- components(a piece of UI) (isolation, independent, reusable) (eg. root compnent, children components)
- implemention: js class with - state (data want to dsiaply when render), 
                              - render method(react element, plain js object present DOM in meory)

theory:
(change react -> change dom [update dome])
React element -> virtual dom 
Dom element -> real dom
